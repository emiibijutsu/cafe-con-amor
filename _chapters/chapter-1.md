# Chapter 1

The warm, familiar scent of Café Bustelo fills the air as the morning rush begins.

Behind the register, Lexi, an Afro-Latina woman with effortless charm, takes orders with practiced ease — from the simple to the absurdly complex. At the bar, Raphael, a focused Cuban man, moves with quiet precision as he crafts everything from iced black coffees to salted caramel lattes, each pour smooth and intentional. Beside him, a sharp-eyed Puerto Rican woman calls out names above the morning rush, checking tickets and navigating the swarm of suits waiting impatiently for their 7:45 fix.

“Café con leche for John! Café aguado for Stephanie!”

Behind the counter, Andrea moves with purpose and pride. She never imagined herself running a café when she was little; what she truly dreamed of was sharing the creativity and love that lived inside her with the people around her. Coffee simply became the canvas that finally let her do it.

As the last customer grabs their drink and the door swings shut behind them, a collective sigh of relief escapes the crew. With the morning rush behind them, they settle into a calmer rhythm, moving through the rest of the morning with practiced ease and a quiet sense of triumph.

Andrea scans the café with quiet satisfaction. A man with a sleek ThinkPad sits with his drink perfectly aligned to the left and the morning paper rolled up on his right. Nearby, a woman gently rocks a stroller, humming softly to calm her fussy baby. Toward the back, Nina, a PhD student at NYU, types furiously — a familiar sight whenever she’s not in class.

Behind the counter, Andrea tends to the baked goods in the glass dome while Lexi steals glances at Nina. Every time Nina shifts, Lexi quickly averts her gaze.

“So you’re into brainiacs, huh?” Raphael smirks, catching her in the act.

Lexi flushes.  

“I just like what she’s wearing today,” she mutters. “She has great fashion sense, that’s all.”  

“Mhm. Then go ask her about her outfit.”  

“N-no! I’m not bothering her while she’s working.”  

“Suit yourself.”

Raphael casually heads toward Nina’s table. Lexi immediately ducks behind the counter.

“Hey,” he says, giving a small wave just at the edge of Nina’s vision.  

Nina looks up. “Oh, hey. What’s up?”

“Not much. Still writing that paper?”  

“Yeah. It’s due tonight and my brain’s fried — I’ve been drowning in articles about this genetic condition.”

“Yikes. Anyway, my friend was wondering where she could get your outfit.”

Nina chuckles. “Ah. Well, I like thrifting in the fashion district. It can be pricey, though, so sometimes I hit shops in Jersey.”

Nina smiles and adjusts the sleeve of her jacket. “This one? Ten bucks at a spot near Journal Square.”

Raphael grins. “You just made someone’s day.”

Lexi peeks up from behind the counter, eyes wide. Nina doesn’t seem to notice — or maybe she’s just being kind.

“Tell her thanks,” Nina says, returning to her screen with a soft smile.


At the counter, Andrea smiles to herself, watching the scene unfold. She may not have had much luck in love herself, but there's something comforting about watching it bloom in others — even from afar.

A few hours go by and the café gets its occasional afternoon pick-me-up orders from young interns and tourists.  
The lull between orders is long enough to get dangerous.

Lexi stacks cups into a perfect little tower on the counter. Raphael leans against the espresso machine, watching her like she’s building the Leaning Tower of Latte.

“You know that’s a health code violation, right?”

Lexi glares. “So is your playlist.”

Raphael gasps in mock offense. “Excuse me—this is classic Bad Bunny.”

She smirks. “Honey, your ‘Latino Heartbreak Hits’ playlist doesn’t give a café vibe.”

“Well, what do you suggest? Lo-fi hip-hop beats to cry to?”

Lexi shrugs. “It’s a vibe.”

He scrolls through the iPad and swaps the song. Something soft and jazzy replaces the reggaeton. They both pause.

“…Okay, fine,” Raphael mutters. “This is nice.”

Lexi beams. “Told you.”

Raphael starts pulling espresso shots. Lexi watches, then playfully bumps him with her hip.

“Bet I can pour a better heart.”

“Oh, we’re doing this?” he grins. “You really want to lose in front of all these… plants?”

They each grab a milk pitcher. One customer wanders in but doesn’t interrupt — it’s clear something fun is happening. Andrea glances over from the pastry case and doesn’t say a word.

Lexi finishes her pour first and turns her latte for Raphael to judge.

He raises an eyebrow. “That’s… definitely a shape. But hey, it’s an attempt!”

“Rude.”

He presents his. A beautifully layered heart within a heart. It’s perfect. Annoyingly perfect.

Lexi sighs. “Ugh. I hate you.”

“You say that, but one day you’ll beg me to teach you my ways.”

Andrea smiles to herself, overhearing the laughter. She says nothing, just wipes down the counter — letting the moment exist.

The afternoon slips by in golden tones. Customers thin out, sunlight fades, and the quiet buzz of espresso machines gives way to the low hum of evening jazz.

Andrea wipes down the counter while Lexi stacks the last of the clean mugs. The front door is locked, the Closed sign flipped, and the café finally exhales.

“End of day magic,” Lexi says, stretching her arms with a yawn.

“More like end of day muscle aches,” Raphael mutters, hauling a box of oat milk from the back. “Pretty sure I’m aging backwards and forwards at the same time.”

Andrea chuckles. “Go restock. I’m not letting you sneak out early again.”

Raphael shoots her a mock glare and disappears into the back pantry. Lexi follows behind him, sorting through the syrup shelf while Raphael checks the milk inventory.

“Yo, is it weird that we go through more lavender syrup than caramel now?”

Lexi shrugs. “Gays love lavender.”

Raphael smirks, setting down a crate. “Explains a lot, actually.”

Raphael grabs a bottle of caramel syrup from a nearby shelf, hesitates for a second, then slowly sets it down.

Lexi notices. “You okay?”

He stares ahead, unfocused.

“…Do you remember that fire in the Bronx a couple years ago? The one with the girl who got pulled out just in time?”

Lexi nods. “Yeah, wasn’t that the one your sister—?”

“Yeah.” He exhales slowly. “She was the one they pulled out. I was there too. We were both inside.”
Lexi pauses, not wanting to interrupt.

“I passed out from the smoke. Barely remember anything. Just heat, sirens, yelling. But I remember someone’s hand on my arm. Cool, steady. Like it was the only real thing in the whole nightmare.”

He stares at his hands for a second.

“I thought it was a dream… until months later, my sister told me someone stayed with her the whole ride to the hospital. Said he didn’t say much. Just held her hand. Told her she’d be okay.”

Lexi swallows. “You ever find out who it was?”

Raphael shakes his head. “Nah. Never got a name. EMTs don’t usually stick around. But she said his voice sounded tired. Like he’d seen too much and didn’t want anyone else to.”

Andrea walks in with a tray of clean cups, catching the tail end of the story — but she doesn’t ask questions. She just gives Raphael a small nod and keeps moving.

The silence that follows isn’t heavy. It’s full.
Raphael doesn’t say anything else.
The jazz hums in the background.
Lexi goes back to sorting cups.
Andrea wipes down the same spot on the counter, lost in thought.

Outside, the streetlights flicker on.
