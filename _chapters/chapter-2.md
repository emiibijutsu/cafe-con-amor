# Chapter 2

“¡Buenas! Welcome to Café Con Amor! What can I get started for you?” Lexi beams, her warmth effortlessly drawing in every customer who walked through the door.

“I’ll do a café con leche with oat milk and a pastelillo de guayaba, please,” said the young businesswoman, barely glancing up from her phone as she slid her card across the counter.

Lexi’s smile stiffened slightly, but she tapped through the POS with practiced ease.

“Sure thing, tap your card whenever you’re ready!”

She looks up from her phone after 5 seconds of still movement, lets out a quiet sigh, and quickly slides her card back. 

“Doing your job for you, I guess,” she mutters, tapping her card with a pointed flick. She struts to the other side of the coffee bar with her face still buried in her cellphone.

Lexi adjusts her rounded glasses, takes a deep breath, and continues taking orders. Meanwhile, behind the counter, Andrea is chatting with a couple of customers waiting at the end of the coffee bar as she puts the finishing touches on drink orders.

“Yes, we’ve been here for close to 7 months now. It’s amazing to see how the customer turnout increased over time,” Andrea states, her hands gently clasping together in satisfaction. “I figured we’d only get a trickle of customers… maybe the occasional food blogger or someone from TikTok.”

Across the counter, the well-dressed businessman quietly chuckles. 

“This is New York City — every new café or restaurant is bound to gain traction, especially if the concept is unique enough. To be honest, I’ve started coming here instead of the Starbucks around the corner from my office. You can only drink so many copy-paste lattes before they all start to taste the same. But your coffee…” he pauses, offering a small smile, “might be the best I’ve had in a long time.” He gestures to the counter, where her hands had just crafted his drink. “You can’t replicate the love and care a small business pours into every cup or pastry. It’s not something a chain can even compete with. I mean that.”
He takes a sip, nodding to himself. 

“You’ll definitely be seeing more of me.”

Then, as if realizing something mid-thought, he looks up.

“Say… I just realized I never got your name, Miss…?”

He trails off, waiting for her to fill in the blank.

“Andrea,” she smiles. “And thank you for such a glowing review. Have a wonderful day and please come back soon!”

He nods and walks out of the café along with a few remaining café patrons. The café becomes much quieter with jazz music buzzing in the background.

Raphael looks at Andrea and wiggles his eyebrows.

“Ay no, he’s not my type,” Andrea rolls her eyes and crouches to grab a damp cleaning rag while keeping one hand on the edge of the counter for support. “I’m not interested right now. The café is my lover.”

“So, when are you and the café getting married?” Raphael teased, bracing in anticipation for a gentle smack from the rag. Andrea shoots up and gently swipes the towel across Raphael’s bicep. He laughs.

“Cállate,” Andrea laughs, gently wiping a nearby dry napkin against Raphael’s arm. Lexi looks over and smiles.

“Yeah, he looks like a man who goes golfing during the week for networking”–Lexi raises her hands to do air quotes when saying networking–”And then goes to the occasional soccer game for his two elementary school children when his wife is busy leading a PTA meeting,” she finishes while laughing.

Raphael looks over at Lexi. “Damn, that was quite the read,” Raphael looks back at Andrea. “If he comes in more, find out more about this guy. I’m willing to bet money on her prediction.”

“Alright, alright,” Andrea says with mock authority, raising an eyebrow. “Back to work. We’re not here to psychoanalyze every rich man who walks in. Everyone’s got their story.”

The trio continue their brief cleaning interlude and serve a few more customers throughout the early afternoon.

“Iced caramel latte for Lizzie! Iced latte with lavender for Skyler!” Andrea calls, gently sliding the drinks across the counter.


She grabs two more drinks from beside the espresso machine, secures the lids, and gives them a gentle swirl to mix the flavors evenly. The girls take their drinks with a smile, thank her, and head out into the afternoon.
In the back corner, Nina sits with her head buried in her laptop. She props her cheek in one hand and lets out a long sigh before closing her eyes.

Lexi glances over and smiles to herself. She walks to the pastry case, grabs the tongs, and picks up the last pastelillo de guayaba. Placing it on a plate, she hangs the tongs back and steps out from behind the counter.
Without a word, she places the plate gently beside Nina’s laptop and takes a shy step back.

“Being a PhD student isn’t for the weak, huh?” she teases, color rising in her cheeks.

Nina opens her eyes and smiles. “Nope. Honestly, I don’t even know how I’m surviving right now.” She chuckles softly. “It’s barely the start of the semester, and I’m already over it.”

“I hear that,” Lexi says. “Back in undergrad, I had this one literature class where we had to read a massive novel every week. I barely made it.”
She laughs. “Though… most of my homework was watching movies. Film history isn’t as easy as it sounds, I swear.”

Nina chuckles, sitting up a little straighter. “I can only imagine. Biology’s just… so broad. It’s like, every time I think I’ve got it, there’s another 50 things to memorize.”

“You’re going for biostats, right?”

“Yeah. I want to be a biostatistician eventually. So this—” she gestures to the chaos on her screen “—is the price I pay.”
“Respect,” Lexi grins. “How long have you been studying biology?”
“Since undergrad. My parents wanted me to be a doctor like them, but I couldn’t deal with the blood. Like, I can dissect frogs just fine… but put me in front of an open chest cavity and I will pass out.”
They both laugh — the kind of laugh that lifts tension, even if just for a moment.
“I guess I should get back to work before my boss fires me,” Lexi says with a grin. “I’ve got bills to pay… and a gecko to feed.”

Nina smiles, eyes twinkling. “Well, I won’t keep you, Gecko Mama.”

She turns back to her chaotic wall of browser tabs. Lexi walks away, trying (and failing) to hide the stupid little smile spreading across her face — her heart just a bit lighter than before.

The sun dips below the skyline, casting soft shadows through the café’s windows. Lexi sweeps the floor while Andrea finishes wiping down the espresso machine. Raphael hums along to the closing playlist, flipping chairs onto tables one by one.

“Another day, another stack of dishes,” Lexi mutters, stretching her arms overhead.

“Hey, Gecko Mama, don’t strain yourself,” Raphael teases.

Lexi shoots him a look, but there’s a grin tucked behind it.

Andrea chuckles, glancing out the window at the now-empty street. “Alright, let’s wrap up. Lexi, kill the lights in the back?”
Lexi nods and disappears behind the counter.

Andrea turns to flip the Closed sign—
But just before she does…

tap tap tap

A soft knock at the door.

She looks up.

A man stands just outside — tired eyes, uniform jacket still zipped halfway, a hand wrapped around a thermos. His posture is slouched from exhaustion, but there’s something steady in the way he looks at her.

Just standing there.

Waiting.

The café is technically closed. But Andrea lingers at the door for a moment too long, hand hovering near the sign.

Lexi returns from the back, stopping when she sees the figure at the door.

“Do you… know him?” she asks quietly.

Andrea doesn’t answer right away.

She stares at the man — his calm presence, the kind of quiet that only comes after chaos. Something about him feels... familiar. 

The lights are off. But something about this moment flickers.
